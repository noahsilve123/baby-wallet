Tax Return Information (Continued)
Since the student spouse 
has not provided consent for 
their federal tax information 
to be transferred directly into 
the FAFSA
® form, the 
student must manually
enter their spouse’s 2023 tax 
return information. The 
student enters a response
in each entry field.

When the student signs their correction 
on their FAFSA® form, a message 
displays informing the student that 
contributor consent and approval is 
missing. The student has the option to 
submit without the contributor consent 
and approval, but they won’t be eligible 
for federal student aid until it is provided. 
The student selects "Sign and Exit."

Manage FAFSA® Contributors Confirmation
After signing their FAFSA® form, the 
student has submitted their correction and 
is presented the confirmation page. This 
page displays information for the student 
about next steps, including tracking their 
FAFSA correction. The student is informed 
that their form is not complete because 
their new spouse needs to resolve error(s) 
in the contributor section(s) and provide 
their signature.

To access an existing FAFSA® form, the 
parent is required to log in using their FSA 
ID (StudentAid.gov account username and 
password). 
322
Consent and Approval Correction Dashboard
On the account Dashboard, the parent 
can see their most recent 2025–26 
FAFSA® activity under the "My Activity" 
section. In this scenario, the parent’s child 
has a processed 2025–26 FAFSA form 
with an "Action Required" status. To see 
further information about this application, 
the parent selects the application and is 
taken to the "Details" page.
323
Consent and Approval Correction Details
On the "Details" page, the parent sees 
information related to their child’s 
processed FAFSA
® form, such as when 
it was started and processed and 
additional resources. In this scenario, 
the parent hasn’t provided consent and 
approval on the form. Selecting 
"Approve" starts a required correction.
324
Consent and Approval Correction Onboarding
When the parent starts a 2025–26 
FAFSA® correction, they are taken 
through the FAFSA correction onboarding 
process. A correction should only be 
submitted if critical information was 
missing, incorrect information was 
provided, the student needs to update 
their selected school(s), and/or a 
correction was requested by a financial 
aid administrator.
325
Consent and Approval Correction Provide Consent and 
Approval
This page informs the parent about 
consent, approval, and the use of their 
federal tax information. By providing 
consent and approval, the parent’s 
federal tax information is transferred 
directly from the IRS into the FAFSA
® 
form to help complete the "Parent 
Financials" section.

Provide Consent and Approval (Continued)
This is a continuation of the consent 
and approval page. Frequently asked 
questions about consent and 
approval are provided that the parent 
can expand and collapse. The parent 
selects "Approve" to provide consent 
and approval. Because the parent 
had previously completed the 
"Parent Financials" section, when 
they select "Approve" to provide 
consent and approval, they are taken 
directly to the signature page.
